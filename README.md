# Location share application for women safety
 
* This is an application that people (women in general) can use to send distress signals to their loved ones along with their current location. And not just that, it also notifies the closest police station about it and also the all the other users to who live near the current location of the user sending the distress signals.

* To avoid people having multiple accounts and fake accounts we use Adhaar card no or any other goverment initials which is unique to every person in India.
